            <h2>What Makes Passwords Weak?</h2>
            <p>Passwords are typically weak due to short and predictable phrases often easily linked to personal data that can be found out by anyone with the ability and interest to look into you even a little bit. Most people have their "passwords" on instagram or whatever social media you use the most. It's commonly  reused across a multitude of accounts making it a one for all as it's easy to remember when you only need 1 password to access your everything.</p>

            <h3>Hard: L0\/e9682513</h3>
